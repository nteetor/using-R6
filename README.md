## Using the R6 package
Because the R6 package is relatively new a lot of standard practices regarding R6 classes (documenting classes, naming conventions, S3 methods, etc.) are still in progress. This repository is an effort to track the repositories and R packages using of the R6 classes in order to assemble something of a how-to.
